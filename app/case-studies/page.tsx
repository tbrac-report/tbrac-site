    summary:
      "A leading Chinese AI company developed advanced facial recognition technology and sought a contract to deploy it across US airport security checkpoints. Given their sector and government adjacency, their initial TBRAC screening flagged immediate exposure across multiple dimensions.",

      "Mandatory CFIUS filing required — transaction met TID US Business threshold under FIRRMA",
      "Company name appeared on DoD 1260H list of Chinese military-civil fusion entities",
      "CCP party committee embedded at board level with no independent US governance structure",
    ],
    outcome:
      "TBRAC's early identification gave the company 8 months to restructure before filing. They established a US subsidiary with a fully independent board, removed party committee representation from governance documents, and engaged CFIUS counsel proactively. The transaction cleared review. Risk tier: Very High → Medium.",

    summary:
      "A major EV battery manufacturer sought to become a Tier-1 supplier to a top-three US automaker. The deal involved significant IP transfer and a proposed joint venture. A 32% stake held by a provincial state-owned enterprise created material CFIUS exposure.",
    findings: [
      "SOE ownership at 32% exceeded thresholds for critical technology supplier classification",
      "US customer data — including vehicle telemetry — routed through servers in Nanjing with no data localization controls",
      "Export Control Classification (ECCN 3E001) not assessed for battery chemistry formulations transferred to US JV",
    ],
    outcome:
      "The company reduced SOE stake to 8% through a secondary share offering, established a US-based data subsidiary with isolated infrastructure, and completed an ECCN classification analysis. CFIUS review completed without mitigation agreement. Certified Low risk in 14 weeks.",

    summary:
      "A Beijing-based HR software company targeting Fortune 500 US clients had a relatively clean profile — fully private ownership, no government contracts, and strong IP documentation. TBRAC was used to identify the remaining gaps before a US sales launch.",
    findings: [
      "No US employment law compliance framework for software handling US employee PII (CCPA, BIPA gaps)",
      "Financial statements not prepared under US GAAP or audited by a PCAOB-registered firm",

Entity list screening returned clean. Achieved Low risk certification in 6 weeks with no structural changes required.",
